 chernobyl.1.d:0 "We have a proposal to build a large nuclear reactor near the town of Pripyat. This will provide large amounts of electricity and if we acquire the right technology, can be used for nuclear weapons."
 chernobyl.1.a:0 "Accept"
 chernobyl.1.b:0 "Deny"
 chernobyl.2.t:0 "Meltdown at Chernobyl Reactor 4"
 chernobyl.2.d:0 "Reactor 4 at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant in Pripyat has suffered a complete meltdown after a test went wrong. The remaining 3 reactors are still operating but most of the town has been evacuated to Kiev, the area is extremely irradiated and the town is quickly falling apart."
 chernobyl.2.a:0 "Oh no!"
 chernobyl.3.t:0 "The Chernobyl Disaster"
 chernobyl.3.d:0 "The Chernobyl disaster, was a catastrophic nuclear accident. It occurred in the No. 4 light water graphite moderated reactor at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant near the now-abandoned town of Pripyat, in northern Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic, Soviet Union, approximately 104 km (65 mi) north of Kiev.\nThe event occurred during a late-night safety test which simulated a station blackout power-failure, in the course of which safety systems were intentionally turned off. A combination of inherent reactor design flaws and the reactor operators arranging the core in a manner contrary to the checklist for the test, eventually resulted in uncontrolled reaction conditions. Water flashed into steam generating a destructive steam explosion and a subsequent open-air graphite fire. This fire produced considerable updrafts for about nine days. These lofted plumes of fission products into the atmosphere. The estimated radioactive inventory that was released during this very hot fire phase approximately equaled in magnitude the airborne fission products released in the initial destructive explosion. This radioactive material precipitated onto parts of the western USSR and Europe. (Source: Wikipedia)"
