NOTES:

Some of these parties only existed for some time, and most of them were pretty insignificant.

Between 1961 and the 1980s there basically were only the SPD, FDP and CDU/CSU.

The BP was first of all a partially separatist movement for Bavaria, but had liberal-conservative tendencies.

Bündnis 90 merged with the Grüne shortly after their formation (Since then it's called Bündnis 90/Die Grünen),but in the time that they existed they were pretty succesful, and pretty much the only purely socialliberal party.

DVP and DDP were disbanded in 1933 by hitler, couldn't find a cold war equivalent.

The WAV was basically only a populist party for all kinds of people, and hard to put into. Some of the members strived for the interests of the Middle Class, others had nationalistic tendencies and others were just opportunists.
First they were for the democratic progress, but later only insulted the political spectrum like other populists.

IB, SIP and Salafiyya are purely fictional, since there's no party equivalent to those ideologies, the Jüdischer Zentralrat and the Zentralrat der Muslime are not radical, but just normal theological organizations, 
just being in here because they would probably be in charge if Judaism or Pan-Arabism comes to power.

The Kirchengeschichtliche Arbeitergemeinschaft did exist, but couldn't quite establish itself on a political level, they were however the successor of the DC (Deutsche Christen), who were basically christian Nazis.
